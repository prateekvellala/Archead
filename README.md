2. Single Right Click
3. Double Left Click
4. Hold Left Click (for dragging, resizing windows, selecting text, etc.)
5. Scroll Up
6. Scroll Down
7. Speech to Text
   1. Enables your microphone, and then whatever you say will be converted to text and typed where your cursor is blinking.
   2. For keys like backspace, space, and enter, you can simply say the key name, and the corresponding action will be performed instead of typing out the word.
   3. For optimal performance, wait at least 2 seconds after performing the gesture corresponding to the speech-to-text functionality before speaking. This delay allows the microphone to activate properly.
